<h3> Notes about interactions/working with implementation teams</h3>

<p> 
On Jan. 30, both of the implementation teams reached out to use on Github via submitting an issue. As we had previously worked on implementating Array and through talking to our Array spec teams, we had some ideas about how to incorporate changes to our API which better matched the given specs and were easiest to implement for the implementation teams. 

After we were notified about changes we had to make, we had to rush to re-create our API and tests. To clarify, the two teams both reached out to us at or after 5pm on Jan. 30 when the assignment was due 8pm on Jan. 31. Despite (in our opinion) the very late notice, we worked diligently to implement changes as quickly as possible in order for the implementation teams to have the most time possible to work on the code with updated specs and tests. 

However, due to the time line and late notice, our comments and tests for the updated specs may not be as extensive or clean as we would like. For example, although we have extensive testing to cover most cases of all function usage with array.h, we tried to push the tests as quickly as possible in order for the implementation team to have a better set of spec guidelines to adhere to. Due to this, our tests are slightly disorganized and rather than organizing by each function, the tests are by classes.
